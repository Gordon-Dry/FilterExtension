# Localization

Localization functionality was added in v3.1.1.

This description refers to all filters shipped with the mod.

* All language localization files are in the folder: 000_FilterExtensions/Lang.
* There is currently only one language shipped (en-us); translations will be gratefully accepted.
* Filter Extension localization IDs all begin with the letters **fe_**.
* The order of IDs doesn't matter, but it makes it easier if translations would use the same groupings as what is already there.
* The IDs are grouped together in relevant groups, comments will, when the localization work is finalized, describe what each block is used for.
* In CATEGORY and SUBCATEGORIES nodes, the **name** field needs to be localized.
* In SUBCATEGORIES lists, the second field for each key is a localized ID.
// This is the only reference to FilterSetIcon.
//* In FilterSetIcon groups, the first field is a localized ID.
